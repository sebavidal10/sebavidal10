## Hi, I'm Sebastián Vidal 🤘🏻

Fan of music, movies, codes and technology. I carry a backpack with several years of experiences in the world of development in various environments and I am constantly looking to add new things to my stack. 

I write reviews of movies and series in [TheBeerbrother](https://thebeerbrother.cl), I do fullstack teaching in [DesafioLatam](https://desafiolatam.com) and I help your web projects make it real from [InterCODE](https://intercode.cl).

Currently, i'm a fullstack developer at [Xepelin](https://www.xepelin.com)
